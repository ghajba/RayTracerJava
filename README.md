# RayTracerJava
Java implementation for a Ray Tracer application -- with a bit of TDD

## The Plan

My idea is to create a simple ray tracer application in Java guided by tests -- alas a bit of TDD, to try out TDD in a project and try to keep me to the RGR-cycle.

The whole idea comes from a book about this topic (yeah, there will be one, not written by me), where you are guided through developing a ray tracer with tests and pseudocode. A lovely thing.

## Tools
I plan to use following tools to aid my development:

* Java 8 (perhaps upgrading to 9 after it is released, around the end of September 2017)
* Spock (because I like the way it adds a bit more to testing)
* Gradle (to learn something new)
* Travic CI (to showcase that all my tests pass ;) )

## Future

* Kotlin (a really future plan to see how Kotlin comes into play and interaction with the other tools -- alternatively a different repository)

## Decisions

While developing I made decisions. I'll explain them in articles at my blog: https//hahamo.wordpress.com
